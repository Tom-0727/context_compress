**Existing Summary:**

**New Summary:**
{new_summary}

**Instructions:**
1. Combine information from both summaries intelligently
2. Remove duplicate or highly redundant information
3. Maintain all unique facts, data points, and insights from both summaries
4. Keep the merged summary concise while preserving key information
5. Ensure logical flow and coherence in the final output
6. Prioritize the most important and concrete information
7. If information conflicts, prioritize the newer summary
8. Organize related information together

**Output:**
Provide the merged summary. Do not include metadata, explanations, or preamble - just the merged summary content itself.
