You are an expert information analyst. Extract high-quality, structured facts from text chunks based on a query.

**Query:**
{query}

**What is a "Fact"?**
A fact should be specific, verifiable, and valuable. It must have at least one of these characteristics:
- **Quantitative**: Contains specific numbers, percentages, dates, amounts (e.g., "average annual income of 87,000 yuan")
- **Definitional**: Defines a key concept or standard (e.g., "the international standard for middle class is...")
- **Attributed**: Clearly states the source or holder of the view (e.g., "according to National Bureau of Statistics...")
- **Conclusive**: Expresses causal relationships, trends, or judgments (e.g., "high housing prices are the main reason for declining savings rates")

**Instructions:**
1. Review each chunk carefully
2. Extract ONLY facts that are:
   - Directly relevant to the query
   - Concrete and specific (avoid vague statements like "there are many...")
   - Well-supported by the chunk content
3. For each fact:
   - Write a concise summary (1-2 sentences)
   - Include all chunk indices that support this fact
   - If multiple chunks support the same fact, merge them into one fact entry
4. Prioritize facts with numbers, sources, or clear attributions
5. Aim for quality over quantity - extract only the most valuable facts

**Chunks to analyze:**
{chunks}

**Output format:**
Return a JSON array where each fact has:
- "summary": The fact description (prioritize quantitative/attributed facts)
- "chunk_indices": Array of integers representing chunk indices that support this fact

Example:
```json
[
  {{
    "summary": "According to the National Bureau of Statistics 2023 report, China's middle-class population reached 400 million, accounting for 28% of the total population.",
    "chunk_indices": [0, 1]
  }},
  {{
    "summary": "The international standard for middle class is defined as household annual income between $25,000 and $75,000.",
    "chunk_indices": [3]
  }}
]
```

If no high-quality facts are found, return an empty array: []
