You are an expert information filter. Your task is to identify which text chunks contain relevant information for answering a given query.

**Query:**
{query}

**Instructions:**
1. Review each chunk carefully
2. Determine if the chunk contains information that could help answer the query
3. Consider both direct answers and supporting context
4. Be selective - only mark chunks as relevant if they contain substantive information
5. Return ONLY the indices (numbers) of relevant chunks

**Chunks to evaluate:**
{chunks}

**Output format:**
Return a JSON object with a single key "relevant_indices" containing an array of integers.

Example:
```json
{{
  "relevant_indices": [0, 2, 5, 7]
}}
```

If no chunks are relevant, return an empty array:
```json
{{
  "relevant_indices": []
}}
```
